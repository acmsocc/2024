		<p>In recent years, the number of clusters and cloud platforms dedicated to deep learning acceleration has increased, and research on multi-tenant deep learning (DL) cluster scheduling systems has also advanced quickly. However, we have observed several shortcomings in these systems. Firstly, resources exhibit heterogeneity, but even the most advanced heterogeneity-aware schedulers can only reach the GPU-type level. In addition, most scheduling systems cannot perform well in balancing efficiency and fairness, which leads to unfair resource allocation and reduced user satisfaction. Moreover, we have noticed the phenomenon of cluster fragmentation and job starvation.</p> <p>In this paper, we propose a new scheduling architecture: Hops, which includes (1) fine-grained heterogeneity awareness and accurate throughput estimators, which allows for heterogeneity awareness at the server entity level. (2) Hops performs resource allocation by executing prior weighted integer linear programming (ILP) for specific placement locations, effectively balancing fairness and efficiency. (3) Hops introduces "latency ratio fairness" (LRF) as a user fairness criterion, which helps reduce starvation and enhance user experience. (4) To address cluster fragmentation, Hops intentionally uses low-sensitivity jobs to fill fragments. The final experimental results show that, in physical experiments, compared with the state-of-the-art scheduling architectures: Sia [17] and Gavel [32], Hops reduces cluster completion time by 18.5% to 34.2%, shortens average job completion time (JCT) by 27.4% to 45.9%, lowers waiting latency by 35.4% to 54.9%, significantly reduces cluster fragmentation, and performs significantly better in fairness metrics compared to Sia and Gavel. In the 512-GPU simulation experiments, Hops not only improves system efficiency but also reduces the maximum job latency ratio by over 21Ã— and decreases cluster fragmentation to less than 1 GPU per round on average.</p>

		<p>Large language model (LLM) serving is becoming an increasingly critical workload for cloud providers. Existing LLM serving systems focus on interactive requests, such as chatbots and coding assistants, with tight latency SLO requirements. However, when such systems execute batch requests that have relaxed SLOs along with interactive requests, it leads to poor multiplexing and inefficient resource utilization. To address these challenges, we propose QLM, a queue management system for LLM serving. QLM maintains batch and interactive requests across different models and SLOs in a request queue. Optimal ordering of the request queue is critical to maintain SLOs while ensuring high resource utilization. To generate this optimal ordering, QLM uses a Request Waiting Time (RWT) Estimator that estimates the waiting times for requests in the request queue. These estimates are used by a global scheduler to orchestrate LLM Serving Operations (LSOs) such as request pulling, request eviction, load balancing, and model swapping. Evaluation on heterogeneous GPU devices and models with real-world LLM serving dataset shows that QLM improves SLO attainment by 40-90% and throughput by 20-400% while maintaining or improving device utilization compared to other state-of-the-art LLM serving systems. QLM's evaluation is based on the production requirements of a cloud provider. QLM is publicly available at https://www.github.com/QLM-project/QLM.</p>

		<p>Large-scale GPU clusters have been widely used for effectively training both online and offline deep learning (DL) jobs. However, elastic scheduling in most cases of resource schedulers is dedicated for offline model training where resource adjustment is planned ahead of time. The native autoscaling policy is on the basis of pre-defined threshold and, if applied directly in online model training, often suffers from belated resource adjustment, leading to diminished model accuracy. In this paper, we present Kale, a novel elastic GPU scheduling system to improve the performance of online DL model training. Through traffic forecasting and resource-throughput modeling, Kale automatically pinpoints the number of required GPUs that best accommodate the on-the-fly data samples before performing stabilized autoscaling. An advanced data shuffling strategy is further employed for balancing uneven samples among different training workers, thereby improving the runtime efficacy. Experiments show that Kale substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions. Compared with the default HPA autoscaling strategy, Kale reduces the accumulated lag and downtime by 69.2% and 33.1%, respectively, whilst lowering the SLO violation rate from 19.57% to just 2.6%. Kale has been deployed at Kuaishou's production-level GPU clusters and successfully underpins real-time video recommendation and advertisement at scale.</p>

		<p>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a new paradigm of machine learning (ML) with the goal of collaborative learning on the vast pool of private data available across distributed edge devices. The focus of most existing works in FL systems has been on addressing the challenges of computation and communication heterogeneity inherent in training with edge devices. However, the crucial impact of I/O and the role of limited on-device storage has not been explored fully in FL context. Without policies to exploit the on-device storage for placement of client data samples, and schedule clients based on I/O benefits, FL training can lead to inefficiencies, such as increased training time and impacted accuracy convergence.</p> <p>In this paper, we propose FedCaSe, a framework for efficiently caching client samples in-situ on limited on-device storage and scheduling client participation. FedCaSe boosts the I/O performance by exploiting a unique characteristic--- the experience, i.e., relative impact on overall performance, of data samples and clients. FedCaSe utilizes this information in adaptive caching policies for sample placement inside the limited memory of edge clients. The framework also exploits the experience information to orchestrate the future selection of clients. Our experiments with representative workloads and policies show that compared to the state of the art, FedCaSe improves the training time by 2.06Ã— for accuracy convergence at the scale of thousands of clients.</p>

		<p>SQL injection is a significant and persistent threat to web services. Most existing protections against SQL injections rely on traffic-level anomaly detection, which often results in high false-positive rates and can be easily bypassed by attackers. This paper introduces SQLStateGuard, the world's first middleware-driven statement-level SQL injection defense approach, to address these issues. The SQLStateGuard uses a custom SQL middleware based on the idea of Runtime Application Self-Protection to capture raw SQL statements. These statements are then analyzed by SQLSG-Net, a database-oriented detection network based on gated linear units. If SQLSG-Net detects malicious SQL statements, the SQL middleware will block them. Experiments show that the detection accuracy of SQLStateGuard exceeds 99%, outperforming existing approaches, and it can identify the type of a specific SQL injection. Additionally, SQLStateGuard has no fingerprint and does not respond to SQL syntax errors, making it more challenging for attackers to gather information. This paper also presents a novel dataset generation process for SQLStateGuard and shares two statement-level SQL injection datasets with the research community, including over 145,000 malicious SQL statements categorized by the type of SQL injection.</p>

		<p>Database performance troubleshooting is a complex multi-step process that broadly involves three key stages- (a) Detection: determining what's wrong and when; (b) Root Cause Analysis (RCA): reasoning about why is the performance poor; (c) Resolution: identifying a fix. A plethora of techniques exist to address each of these problems, but they hardly work in real-world at scale. First, real-world customer workloads are noisy, non-stationary and quasi-periodic in nature rendering traditional detectors ineffective. Second, real-world production databases execute a highly diverse set of queries that skew the database statistics into long-tail distributions causing traditional RCA methods to fail. Third, these databases typically execute millions of such diverse queries every minute rendering traditional methods inefficient when deployed at scale.</p> <p>In this paper we describe Vista, a machine learning based performance troubleshooting framework for databases, and dive-deep into how it addresses the 3 real-world problems outlined above. Vista deploys a deep auto-regressive model trained on a large and diverse Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) fleet with custom skip connections and periodicity alignment features to model long range and varying periodicity in customer workloads, and detects performance bottlenecks in the form of outliers. Furthermore, it efficiently filters only a top few dominating SQL queries from millions in a problematic workload, and uses a robust causal inference framework to identify the culprit queries and their statistics leading to a low false-positive and false-negative rate. Currently, Vista runs on hundreds of thousands of RDS databases, analyzes millions of workloads every day bringing down the troubleshooting time for RDS customers from hours to seconds. At the end, we also describe several challenges and learnings from implementing and deploying Vista at Amazon scale.</p>

		<p>The rapid growth in the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI Agents as part of software development and deployment is revolutionizing the information technology landscape. While code generation receives significant attention, a higher-impact application lies in using agents for the operational resilience of cloud services, which currently require significant human effort and domain knowledge. There is a growing interest in AI for IT Operations (AIOps), which aims to automate complex operational tasks, like fault localization and root cause analysis, reducing human intervention and customer impact. However, achieving the vision of autonomous and self-healing clouds through AIOps is hampered by the lack of standardized frameworks for building, evaluating, and improving AIOps agents. This vision paper lays the groundwork for such a framework by framing the requirements and then discussing design decisions that satisfy them. We also propose AIOpsLab, a prototype implementation leveraging agent-cloud-interface that orchestrates an application, injects real-time faults using chaos engineering, and interfaces with an agent to localize and resolve the faults. We report promising results and lay the groundwork to build a modular and robust framework for building, evaluating, and improving agents for autonomous clouds.</p>

		<p>While many studies have been conducted to detect abnormal behavior in cloud environments by analyzing system call sequences, these studies often cannot be applied to real-world cloud environments since they do not consider actual user behavior and rely on publicly available datasets. In actual cloud environments, the frequency of duplicate system calls is significantly higher than that observed in these datasets. This discrepancy necessitates a considerably larger scale of analysis to fully understand the sequential relationships among system calls. In this paper, we propose a practical abnormal behavior detection system for private cloud environments. The proposed system comprises of a deduplicated embedding process that efficiently represents duplicate system calls occurring within the cloud into a single embedding vector and a zero-shot abnormal behavior detection process that rapidly analyzes the large volume of system call sequences generated by numerous users through a zero-shot learning model. To demonstrate the practicality of our proposed system, we use both publicly available datasets and datasets directly collected from real cloud environments by implementing attacks from the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework as a proof of concept (PoC). Experimental results show that our system achieved an accuracy an accuracy of 92.13%, and it can detect attacks 5.48 times faster than existing research.</p>

		<p>There has been a growing demand for making modern cloud-based data analytics systems cost-effective and easy to use. AI-powered intelligent resource scaling is one such effort, aiming at automating scaling decisions for serverless offerings like Amazon Redshift Serverless. The foundation of intelligent resource scaling lies in the ability to forecast query workloads and their resource consumption accurately. Although the forecasting problem has been extensively studied across various domains, there is a lack of thorough analysis of existing forecasting algorithms for large-scale, real-world cloud query workloads. This paper fills this gap by providing an in-depth analysis of forecasting algorithms for real-world cloud workloads, covering the fundamental data characteristics that distinguish query workload forecasting from prior problems and evaluating the strengths and limitations of existing algorithms in this new domain. We anticipate that our findings will provide valuable insights in informing the design of an efficient and effective solution for production use, as well as in steering the forecasting community toward more effective algorithms of high real-world impact.</p>

		<p>Due to the frequent starts and stops of numerous services in FaaS (Function as a Service), reducing cold start overhead is a core issue in improving the performance of container-based FaaS services. Snapshot and restore-based mechanisms effectively reduce the cold start time of containers by transforming container initialization overhead into restoration overhead. Consequently, this mechanism has become a research hotspot in accelerating the cold start of FaaS containers. Researchers introduce snapshot compression and decompress the snapshots to reduce the storage cost before starting instances. However, existing works have the following shortcomings: (1) File-mapped memory pages are not processed during snapshot compression, resulting in a significant amount of redundant data in memory; (2) The serial execution of snapshot decompression and instance restoration leads to high instance startup latency.</p> <p>To address these shortcomings, we propose the Snapipeline mechanism, which implements the following optimizations: (1) In the snapshot compression phase, it extends deduplication to file-mapped memory; (2) In the restoration phase, it leverages the hot and cold distinction in FaaS application memory to prioritize the memory pages restoration, pipelining snapshot decompression, memory pages restoration, and function execution. This mechanism hides the expensive snapshot decompression latency behind the instance restoration and function execution latency and removes the snapshot decompression from the critical path of instance startup. Evaluation on real-world FaaS application datasets shows that Snapipeline reduces memory usage by up to 28% and decreases end-to-end latency by an average of 53%, compared to the baseline.</p>

		<p>Serverless computing promises scalability and cost-efficiency by decomposing monolithic tasks into small, stateless, self-contained functions. As functions only reserve hardware resources during their lifetime, and serverless providers such as Amazon Lambda define strict data size limits [50], data required for the whole lifetime of a monolithic task needs to be kept in an external ephemeral data store. This approach increases costs and introduces performance variability, causing serverless applications to violate service level objectives (SLOs). Traditional cloud storage solutions, such as AWS S3 and Redis, fail to provide low-cost and the enforcement of SLOs, while prior works on disaggregated data stores do not scale sufficiently due to: (1) increased scheduling costs when supporting many SLOs; (2) performance degradation in the presence of burst allowances and worsened interference with lenient ones; and (3) failed service differentiation with increased number of SLO. These challenges make SLO enforcement in serverless environments difficult, leading to unpredictable performance and costs that undermine the benefits of serverless computing.</p> <p>We introduce En4S, a high-performance, flash-based storage system designed for data-intensive serverless applications. En4S employs a profile-based scheduling framework with adaptive strategies to efficiently scale to many tenants with different SLOs. Key features include dynamic tenant handling, adaptive burst control, token reclaim control, and various optimizations to minimize scheduling costs while maintaining superior performance. By re-enabling SLO enforcement for disaggregated flash storage in cloud-native environments, En4S is crucial for modern serverless applications. Our implementation on Amazon EC2 and Lambda demonstrates substantial performance and cost improvements while reliably ensuring SLO compliance, enhancing the viability of serverless storage systems.</p>

		<p>Serverless computing has rapidly prospered as a new cloud computing paradigm with agile scalability, pay-as-you-go pricing, and ease-to-use features for Machine Learning (ML) inference tasks. Users package their ML code into lightweight serverless functions and execute them using containers. Unfortunately, a notorious problem, called cold-starts, hinders serverless computing from providing low-latency function executions. To mitigate cold-starts, pre-warming, which keeps containers warm predictively, has been widely accepted by academia and industry. However, pre-warming fails to eliminate the unique latency incurred by loading ML artifacts. We observed that for ML inference functions, the loading of libraries and models takes significantly more time than container warming. Consequently, pre-warming alone is not enough to mitigate the ML inference function's cold-starts.</p> <p>This paper introduces InstaInfer, an opportunistic preloading technique to achieve instant inference by eliminating the latency associated with loading ML artifacts, thereby achieving minimal time cost in function execution. InstaInfer fully utilizes the memory of warmed containers to preload the function's libraries and model, striking a balance between maximum acceleration and resource wastage. We design InstaInfer to be transparent to providers and compatible with existing pre-warming solutions. Experiments on OpenWhisk with real-world workloads show that InstaInfer reduces up to 93% loading latency and achieves up to 8Ã— speedup compared to state-of-the-art pre-warming solutions.</p>

		<p>This paper quantitatively analyses the potential of vertical scaling MicroVMs in serverless computing. Our analysis shows that under real-world serverless workloads, vertical scaling can significantly improve execution performance and resource utilization. However, we also find that the memory scaling of MicroVMs is the bottleneck that hinders vertical scaling from reaching the performance ceiling. We propose Faascale, a novel mechanism that efficiently scales the memory of MicroVMs for serverless applications. Faascale employs a series of techniques to tackle this bottleneck: 1) it sizes up/down the memory for a MicroVM by blocks that bind with a function instance instead of general pages; and 2) it pre-populates physical memory for function instances to reduce the delays introduced by the lazy-population. Compared with existing memory scaling mechanisms, Faascale improves the memory scaling efficiency by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude. We implement Faascale on Amazon Firecracker to evaluate its gains for the serverless platform. The results of experiments conducted on eight serverless benchmark functions demonstrate that compared with horizontal scaling strategies based the state-of-the-art snapshots technique, Faascale reduces time for cold-starting MicroVMs by 89.01% and functions execution time by 23.93% on average.</p>

		<p>Serverless platforms rely on legacy networking stacks for communication and data movement. We quantitatively analyze the performance of these stacks and show their mismatch with highly consolidated, virtualized modern serverless environments, focusing on Firecracker, the most common serverless virtualization framework. As serverless applications grow in complexity and interaction, the resulting network bottleneck is a prime source of user-perceived, end-to-end latency. In this paper, we present a detailed vision of a new, sidecar-based networking stack for serverless environments. Our primary design goal is to provide low-overhead networking while maintaining existing security guarantees. We outline the research challenges in both the control and the data plane that the community needs to tackle before such a sidecar architecture can be used in practice.</p>

		<p>Fine-grained serverless functions power many new applications that benefit from elastic scaling and pay-as-you-use billing model with minimal infrastructure management overhead. To achieve these properties, Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms disaggregate compute and state and, consequently, introduce non-trivial costs due to the loss of data locality when accessing state, complex control plane interactions, and expensive inter-function communication. We revisit the foundations of FaaS and propose a new cloud abstraction, the cloud process, that retains all the benefits of FaaS while significantly reducing the overheads that result from disaggregation. We show how established operating system abstractions can be adapted to provide powerful granular computing on dynamically provisioned cloud resources while building our Process as a Service (PraaS) platform. PraaS improves current FaaS by offering data locality, fast invocations, and efficient communication. PraaS delivers remote invocations up to 17Ã— faster and reduces communication overhead by up to 99%.</p>

		<p>Burstable instances provide a low-cost option for consumers using the public cloud, but they come with significant resource limitations. They can be viewed as "fractional instances" where one receives a fraction of the compute and memory capacity at a fraction of the cost of regular instances. The fractional compute is achieved via rate limiting, where a unique characteristic of the rate limiting is that it allows for the CPU to burst to 100% utilization for limited periods of time. Prior research has shown how this ability to burst can be used to serve specific roles such as a cache backup and handling flash crowds. Our work provides a general-purpose approach to meeting latency SLOs via this burst capability while optimizing for cost. AutoBurst is able to achieve this by controlling both the number of burstable and regular instances along with how/when they are used. Evaluations show that our system is able to reduce cost by up to 25% over the state-of-the-art while maintaining latency SLOs.</p>

		<p>Cold-start times have been the "end-all, be-all" metric for research in serverless cloud computing over the past decade. Reducing the impact of cold starts matters, because they can be the biggest contributor to a serverless function's end-to-end execution time. Recent studies from cloud providers, however, indicate that, in practice, a majority of serverless functions are triggered by non-interactive workloads. To substantiate this, we study the types of serverless functions used in 35 publications and find that over 80% of functions are not semantically latency sensitive. If a function is non-interactive and latency insensitive, is end-to-end execution time the right metric to optimize in serverless? What if cold starts do not matter that much, after all?</p> <p>In this vision paper, we explore what serverless environments in which cold starts do not matter would look like. We make the case that serverless research should focus on supporting latency insensitive, i.e., batch, workloads. Based on this, we explore the design space for DFaaS, a serverless framework with an execution model in which functions can be arbitrarily delayed. DFaaS users annotate each function with a delay tolerance and, as long as the deadline has not passed, the runtime may interrupt or migrate function execution. Our micro-benchmarks suggest that, by targeting batch workloads, DFaaS can improve substantially the resource usage of serverless clouds and lower costs for users.</p>

A single customer of ours migrates their nested, cloud-based, user virtual machines tens of thousands of times a month.</p> <p>Ballooning is one technique for modifying the size of a virtual machine and has been used to speed up VM migration and increase VM consolidation. However, it has a significant risk: the ominous out-of-memory (OOM) error. The issue is that it is infeasible to use ballooning during high-risk scenarios, namely during giant memory spikes and during live migration, for fear of swapping or worse, OOM errors.</p> <p>We advance the state of the art by optimizing the Linux balloon driver for VM migration in a non-overcommitted context, resulting in being able to handle both high-risk scenarios without relying on swapping and without causing OOM errors.

		<p>Application containers are widely used in contemporary cloud computing environments. Migration of containers across hosts provides cost-effective cloud management by enabling improved server consolidation, load balancing and enhanced fault tolerance. One of the primary objectives of container migration is to reduce the service downtime of applications hosted in containers. The service downtime depends on performing the migration activities efficiently, specifically from the time the container is stopped on the source host till it is restored and fully functional at the destination host.</p> <p>In this paper, we show that, the state-of-the-art pre-copy migration strategy for containers using checkpoint and restore techniques (e.g., CRIU) inflates the downtime due to its inherent limitations in the restoration procedures, particularly for containers with large memory working set size. We propose PCLive to address this bottleneck using a pipelined restore mechanism. Compared to the baseline CRIU pre-copy migration, PCLive results in up to ~38.8x reduction in restoration time which leads to a reduction of service downtime by up to ~2.7x for migration of a container hosting the Redis key-value store over an one Gbps network. We also present comprehensive comparative analysis of the resource cost for the proposed solution along with additional optimizations to demonstrate that PCLive can reduce the application downtime in a resource efficient manner leveraging its flexible and efficient design choices.</p>

		<p>Modern datacenters run diverse workloads that increasingly comprise data-parallel computational jobs. There has been a steady rise in their demand leading to high-volume traffic. To meet these demands, datacenter providers operate their clusters at levels of high utilization. We show that under such conditions, existing schedulers impose large wait times on tail tasks, leading to long job completion time. We propose a new decentralized scheduler, Murmuration, that reduces the total wait time of tasks. It employs multiple communicating schedulers to schedule tasks of jobs such that their start times are as close together as possible, ensuring small tail task completion time and better average job completion time.</p> <p>Our evaluation of Murmuration using publicly available workloads on a real-world cluster shows 15% --- 25% faster job completion time than that of the default Kubernetes scheduler for different arrival characteristics.

We further enhance the design of Murmuration by incorporate queue reordering techniques to order the scheduling and execution of jobs and tasks. Simulations evaluated on two industry workloads show that with queue re-ordering, Murmuration outperforms other schedulers with a 100Ã— better median job completion time than that of current schedulers.</p>

		<p>Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are an important facet of global connectivity providing high speed Internet, cellular, IoT connectivity and so on. Combined with the rich resource availability on each satellite, LEO satellites represent a new, emerging cloud frontier - the LEO Compute Cloud. However, satellite mobility introduces non-trivial challenges when orchestrating applications for a LEO compute cloud, making it harder to deploy applications without increasing the latency and bandwidth costs. In this paper, we identify the concrete challenges in using state-of-the-art terrestrial orchestrators for a LEO compute cloud. We present Krios - a LEO compute cloud orchestration system that hides the complexities introduced by satellite mobility and enables a practical LEO compute cloud. The design of Krios is centered around a novel LEO zones abstraction that allows application providers to specify where their applications should be available. Krios provides crucial system support to enable the LEO zones abstraction, ensuring uninterrupted availability of applications in LEO zones via proactive and predictive application handovers. Our experimental evaluation of Krios with representative applications demonstrates a practical and efficient LEO compute cloud, without requiring any disruptive changes in applications and with modest system overheads. With Krios, LEO orchestration requires just ~1 application instance at a time to maintain the same availability as what prior work achieves by deploying application instances on all satellites or by performing 6-10 times more frequent expensive handovers.</p>

		<p>The presence of unhealthy nodes in cloud infrastructure signals the potential failure of machines, which can significantly impact the availability and reliability of cloud services, resulting in negative customer experiences.

This paper introduces Deoxys, a causal inference engine tailored to recommending mitigation actions for unhealthy node in cloud systems to minimize virtual machine downtime and interruptions during unhealthy events. It employs double machine learning combined with causal forest to produce precise and reliable mitigation recommendations based solely on limited observational data collected from the historical unhealthy events. To enhance the causal inference model, Deoxys further incorporates a policy fallback mechanism based on model uncertainty and action overriding mechanisms to (i) improve the reliability of the system, and (ii) strike a good tradeoff between downtime reduction and resource utilization, thereby enhancing the overall system performance.</p> <p>After deploying Deoxys in a large-scale cloud infrastructure at Microsoft, our observations demonstrate that Deoxys significantly reduces average VM downtime by 53% compared to a legacy policy, while leading to 49.5% lower VM interruption rate.

		<p>Reducing tail latency has become a crucial issue for optimizing the performance of online cloud services and distributed applications. In distributed applications, there are many causes of high end-to-end tail latency, including operating system delays, request re-ordering due to fan-out/fanin, and network congestion. Although recent research has focused on reducing tail latency for individual application components, such as by replicating requests and scheduling, in this paper, we argue for a holistic approach for reducing the end-to-end tail latency across application components. We propose TailClipper, a distributed scheduler that tags each arriving request with an arrival timestamp, and propagates it across the microservices' call chain. TailClipper then uses arrival timestamps to implement an oldest request first scheduler that combines global first-come first serve with a limited form of processor sharing to reduce end-to-end tail latency. In doing so, TailClipper can counter the performance degradation caused by request reordering in multi-tiered and microservices-based applications. We implement TailClipper as a userspace Linux scheduler and evaluate it using cloud workload traces and a real-world microservices application. Compared to state-of-the-art schedulers, our experiments reveal that TailClipper improves the 99th percentile response time by up to 81%, while also improving the mean response time and the system throughput by up to 54% and 29% respectively under high loads.</p>

		<p>Leveraging serverless computing for cloud-based machine learning services is on the rise, promising cost-efficiency and flexibility are crucial for ML applications relying on high-performance GPUs and substantial memory. However, despite modern serverless platforms handling diverse devices like GPUs seamlessly on a pay-as-you-go basis, a longstanding challenge remains: startup latency, a well-studied issue when serverless is CPU-centric. For example, initializing GPU apps with minor GPU models, like MobileNet, demands several seconds. For more intricate models such as GPT-2, startup latency can escalate to around 10 seconds, vastly overshadowing the short computation time for GPU-based inference. Prior solutions tailored for CPU serverless setups, like fork() and Checkpoint/Restore, cannot be directly and effectively applied due to differences between CPUs and GPUs.</p> <p>This paper presents gCROP (GPU Checkpoint/Restore made On-demand and Parallel), the first GPU runtime that achieves &lt;100ms startup latency for GPU apps with up to 774 million parameters (3.1GB GPT-2-Large model). The key insight behind gCROP is to selectively restore essential states on demand and in parallel during boot from a prepared checkpoint image. To this end, gCROP first introduces a global service, GPU Restore Server, which can break the existing barrier between restore stages and achieve parallel restore. Besides, gCROP leverages both CPU and GPU page faults, and can on-demand restore both CPU and GPU data with profile-guided order to mitigate costs caused by faults. Moreover, gCROP designs a multi-checkpoint mechanism to increase the common contents among checkpoint images and utilizes deduplication to reduce storage costs. Implementation and evaluations on AMD GPUs show significant improvement in startup latency, 6.4x-24.7x compared with booting from scratch and 3.9x-23.5x over the state-of-the-art method (CRIU).</p>

		<p>Mixture of Expert (MoE) models consist of several experts, each specializing in a specific task. During inference, a subset of the experts is invoked based on their relevance to the request. MoE's modular architecture lets users compose their model from popular off-the-shelf experts. This leads to multiple MoE deployments with identical experts. The duplication of experts across model instances results in excessive GPU memory consumption and increased model serving cost. Moreover, since all experts are not invoked for each request, individual experts rarely receive enough requests to exploit the GPUs' computational capabilities, resulting in low GPU utilization. To address these problems, we propose Shared Mixture of Experts in MoEsaic. MoEsaic automatically identifies and deduplicates identical experts across model instances, thus reducing their memory footprint. Moreover, it batches the requests directed toward the identical experts belonging to different clients, which also improves the processing efficiency. We show that for Mixtral-8x7B model, when compared to deploying dedicated MoE instances, MoEsaic can serve 7X more model instances with little impact on inference performance.</p>

		<p>Serverless computing platforms have become increasingly popular for running machine learning (ML) tasks due to their user-friendliness and decoupling from underlying infrastructure. However, auto-scaling to efficiently serve incoming requests still remains a challenge, especially for distributed ML training or inference jobs in a serverless GPU cluster. Distributed training and inference jobs are highly sensitive to resource configurations, and demand high model efficiency throughout their lifecycle. We propose FaPES, a FaaS-oriented Performance-aware Elastic Scaling system to enable efficient resource allocation in serverless platforms for ML jobs. FaPES enables flexible resource loaning between virtual clusters for running training and inference jobs. For running inference jobs, servers are reclaimed on demand with minimal preemption overhead to guarantee service level objective (SLO); for training jobs, optimal GPU allocation and model hyperparameters are jointly adapted based on an ML-based performance model and a resource usage prediction board, alleviating users from model tuning and resource specification.

		<p>Federated learning allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared model without sharing local private data. It is regarded as privacy-preserving since only model updates are communicated. Unfortunately, it has been shown in the recent literature that, model updates transmitted by participating clients can be used by a malicious server in gradient leakage attacks to obtain private training data. To prevent such potential leakage from occurring, it has widely been acknowledged that homomorphic encryption can be used to encrypt these model updates before sending them to the server, which performs computations directly on encrypted data. Although homomorphic encryption has a strong guarantee on privacy, its practical use increases communication overhead by around 17Ã—, even with its most efficient implementation, called CKKS. In this paper, we present Pack, a novel communication-efficient mechanism over CKKS, designed specifically to reduce the communication overhead by a substantial margin. In addition, we propose new error correction and weight filtering mechanisms in Pack to improve the accuracy of the trained model. Compared to vanilla CKKS, Pack reduces the communication overhead by 3.1Ã—, while increasing the accuracy by 5.5% and 2.5% under the i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. settings.</p>

		<p>The increasing power consumption of AI inference in modern datacenters has escalated cooling demands significantly, necessitating the adoption of potent cooling approaches like water cooling. Unlike traditional cloud workloads, AI inference has unique characteristics that create substantial gaps in achieving optimal cooling efficiency. In this work, we present the first comprehensive measurement study of AI inference cooling across various models within an industrial-ready scheduling framework, highlighting significant inefficiencies and their causes. To fill the gap while following the fundamental requirements of cooling systems, we explore a new opportunity presented by modern Multi-Instance GPU-enabled inference serving, where the scheduling dimension is naturally orthogonal to the cooling dimension. Building on this insight, we develop InferCool, a cooling middleware designed to enhance cooling efficiency for inference serving through transparent, non-intrusive task reassignment. It includes a streamlined power and temperature prediction approach and a thermal-aware, adaptive application deployment and request scheduling mechanism. Real-world experiments on a water-cooled testbed and a three-node cluster demonstrate that InferCool can reduce the maximum GPU temperature by 5Â°C across eight A100 GPUs, equivalent to cooling energy savings of about 20%. Importantly, InferCool requires no modifications to existing cooling infrastructures and is compatible with existing scheduling systems.</p>

		<p>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are Internet-scale systems that deliver streaming and web content to users from many geographically distributed edge data centers. Since large CDNs can comprise hundreds of thousands of servers deployed in thousands of global data centers, they can consume a large amount of energy for their operations and thus are responsible for large amounts of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. As these networks scale to cope with increased demand for bandwidth-intensive content, their emissions are expected to rise further, making sustainable design and operation an important goal for the future. Since different geographic regions vary in the carbon intensity and cost of their electricity supply, in this paper, we consider spatial shifting as a key technique to jointly optimize the carbon emissions and energy costs of a CDN. We present two forms of shifting: spatial load shifting, which operates within the time scale of minutes, and VM capacity shifting, which operates at a coarse time scale of days or weeks. The proposed techniques jointly reduce carbon and electricity costs while considering the performance impact of increased request latency from such optimizations. Using real-world traces from a large CDN and carbon intensity and energy prices data from electric grids in different regions, we show that increasing the latency by 60ms can reduce carbon emissions by up to 35.5%, 78.6%, and 61.7% across the US, Europe, and worldwide, respectively. In addition, we show that capacity shifting can increase carbon savings by up to 61.2%. Finally, we analyze the benefits of spatial shifting and show that it increases carbon savings from added solar energy by 68% and 130% in the US and Europe, respectively.</p>

		<p>Cloud computing is a significant and growing cause of carbon emissions. Understanding the energy consumption and carbon footprints of cloud applications is a fundamental prerequisite to raising awareness, designing sustainability metrics, and creating targeted system optimizations. In this paper, we address the challenges of providing accurate and full-system (not just CPU) carbon footprints for serverless (FaaS) functions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which develops an energy and carbon metrology framework for FaaS.</p> <p>Carbon footprints require a new approach to energy profiling. We use FaaS workload properties such as locality to develop a simple and practical online statistical disaggregation approach. Our fine-grained per-invocation carbon footprints also include shared hardware and software emissions, and use insights from Shapley values to fairly account for both operational and embodied emissions. Owing to the growing importance of carbon measurement, we develop a new rigorous marginal energy based validation methodology which results in accountable, complete, and fair footprints. Over a wide range of FaaS workloads and hardware platforms, our energy footprints have an accuracy of &gt; 99%.</p>

		<p>The rapid increase in computing demand and corresponding energy consumption have focused attention on computing's impact on the climate and sustainability. Prior work proposes metrics that quantify computing's carbon footprint across several lifecycle phases, including its supply chain, operation, and end-of-life. Industry uses these metrics to optimize the carbon footprint of manufacturing hardware and running computing applications. Unfortunately, prior work on optimizing datacenters' carbon footprint often succumbs to the sunk cost fallacy by considering embodied carbon emissions (a sunk cost) when making operational decisions (i.e., job scheduling and placement), which leads to operational decisions that do not always reduce the total carbon footprint.</p> <p>In this paper, we evaluate carbon-aware job scheduling and placement on a given set of servers for several carbon accounting metrics. Our analysis reveals state-of-the-art carbon accounting metrics that include embodied carbon emissions when making operational decisions can increase the total carbon footprint of executing a set of jobs. We study the factors that affect the added carbon cost of such suboptimal decision-making. We then use a real-world case study from a datacenter to demonstrate how the sunk carbon fallacy manifests itself in practice. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings in better guiding effective carbon-aware scheduling in on-premise and cloud datacenters.</p>

		<p>Modular data centers (MDCs) that can be placed right at the energy farms and powered mostly by renewable energy, is a flexible and effective approach to lowering the carbon footprint of data centers. However, the main challenge of using renewable energy is the high variability of power produced, which implies large volatility in powering computing resources at MDCs, and degraded application performance due to the task evictions and migrations. This causes challenges for platform operators to decide the MDC deployment.</p> <p>To this end, we present SkyBox, a framework that employs a learning-based approach for platform operators to explore the efficient use of renewable energy with MDC deployment across geographical regions. SkyBox is driven by the insights based on our study of real-world power traces from a variety of renewable energy farms - the predictable production of renewable energy and the complementary nature of energy production patterns across different renewable energy sources and locations. With these insights, SkyBox uses the coefficient of variation metric to select the qualified renewable farms, it can identify a set of farms with complementary energy production patterns with a subgraph identification algorithm. After that, SkyBox enables smart workload placement and migrations to further tolerate the power variability. Our experiments with real power traces and datacenter workloads show that SkyBox has the lowest carbon emissions compared with existing approaches. SkyBox also minimizes the negative impact of the power variability on cloud applications, enabling it an effective solution of utilizing renewable energy for modern data centers.</p>

		<p>Unikernels specialize operating systems by tailoring the kernel for a specific application at compile time. While the specialized library OS approach provides a smaller OS image-thus improving the bootup process, performance, migration costs, and reliable/trusted computing base---at the same time, unikernels lack run-time extensibility, which is imperative to support "on-demand" auxiliary tasks and tools, e.g., debugging, monitoring, re-configuration, and system management and deployment in a typical cloud environment. Consequently, unikernels present a fundamental trade-off between slimness of the OS image size at the compile time vs. flexibility of supported auxiliary functionality at the run-time.</p> <p>This work strives to balance this trade-off by keeping the unikernel system image as minimal as possible to solely support the application functionality in the "common case", while providing "on-demand" extensibility for auxiliary tasks at run-time. The key challenge is to support run-time extensibility through a generic interface in a safe manner.</p> <p>To this end, the paper presents uIO---a "safe overlay" abstraction to provide runtime extensibility in unikernels, while maintaining the unikernel benefits. In particular, uIO leverages a generic VirtIO-based interface to provide an overlay for auxiliary programs, i.e., users can load external programs into the unikernels' address space and run them, i.e., "on-demand" extensibility through a generic file system interface. To provide safe execution within an overlay, uIO provides isolation mechanisms leveraging hardware-assisted memory isolation (MPK) and language-runtime-based execution (eBPF). We implement a prototype of uIO based on Unikraft and demonstrate its applicability to support a range of auxiliary use cases. uIO incurs negligible performance overheads for application execution in the common case while providing run-time extensibility to support auxiliary use cases.</p>

		<p>Cloud storage systems often adopt state machine replication (SMR) to ensure reliability and availability. Most SMR systems use "full-copy" replication across all nodes, which leads to degraded performance for data-intensive workloads, due to high disk and network I/O costs. Erasure coding has recently been integrated with leader-based SMR systems to reduce the costs, e.g., RS-Paxos, CRaft, HRaft, and FRaft. However, these systems still have bottlenecks at the leader, limiting their performance when handling large datasets.</p> <p>To address the bottlenecks, this paper proposes Racos, which integrates erasure coding with a recent leaderless SMR protocol, Rabia Unlike Paxos or Raft, Rabia uses a leaderless design for reaching consensus, making it suitable for our purpose. Compared to a leader-based design, Racos distributes workload evenly, alleviating the bottlenecks.</p> <p>We integrate our system Racos with etcd, a distributed key-value storage that powers many production systems including Kubernetes. Our evaluation, using YCSB, shows that Racos outperforms the closest competitors by up to 2.26x in throughput within local-area networks and reduce median latency by up to 76.8% in wide variety of workloads.</p>

		<p>Optimizing distributed protocols has traditionally been a real pain, requiring experts to figure out where improvements can be made, along with rigorous correctness proofs and meticulous implementation. This paper presents a theory to systematize this process. The proposed theory can optimize any existing distributed protocols while preserving all their original quality attributes (e.g., generality, correctness). Crucially, applying the optimizations derived from this theory does not necessitate touching the original implementation --- all you need is just to bolt on a few new message adapters. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. For instance, applying the theory to optimize Spanner's atomic commit protocol results in a mere 4 new message adapters, but improving its latency by up to 51% and peak throughput by up to 56%.</p>

		<p>Due to the susceptibility to nothing-at-stake and long-range attacks, the Proof-of-Stake consensus faces challenges in securely and efficiently confirming blocks. We propose a new Proof-of-Stake consensus, Voted Weightest Sub-Tree(VWeiST) consensus. It assigns weights to each block through voting, and nodes confirm blocks by calculating the probability that each block's weight can be exceeded by other competitors. We employ a multi-round voting approach, where a small number of nodes are randomly selected as the committee nodes to vote in each round. This approach results in particularly low communication overhead per block, allowing for scalability to a large number of nodes. Compared to other consensus, our mechanism requires fewer rounds of voting to confirm a block, offering advantages in throughput and transaction latency. In the experiments, VWeiST achieves latency and round reductions down to 40% and 29% of the comparison method's levels at most. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that the consensus ensures liveness and probabilistic safety.</p>

		<p>Current serverless platforms introduce non-trivial overheads when chaining and orchestrating loosely-coupled microservices. Containerized function runtimes are also constrained by insufficient isolation and excessive startup time. This motivates our exploration of a more efficient, secure, and rapid serverless design. We describe SURE, a unikernel-based serverless framework for fast function startup, equipped with a high-performance and secure data plane. SURE's data plane supports distributed zero-copy communication via the seamless interaction between zero-copy protocol stack (Z-stack) and local shared memory processing. To establish a lightweight service mesh, SURE uses library-based sidecars instead of individual userspace sidecars. We leverage Intel's Memory Protection Keys (MPK) as a lightweight capability to ensure safe access to the shared memory data plane. It also isolates the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) components in SURE's function runtime (e.g., library-based sidecar, scheduler, etc) from untrusted user code, while preserving the efficient single-address-space nature of unikernels. In particular, SURE prevents unintended privilege escalation involving MPK with an enhanced TCB. These combined efforts create a more secure and robust data plane while improving throughput up to 79X over Knative, a representative open-source serverless platform.</p>

		<p>In modern disaggregated datacenters, the storage network which interconnects the compute and memory pools becomes the performance bottleneck. The high-end RDMA devices cannot meet the complex requirements of storage networks, due to the limited RDMA semantics and throughput. Existing solutions essentially follow the monolithic design, so they suffer from underutilized resources and high scaling costs. In this paper, we design TianMen, which offloads the storage network by extending RDMA semantics and customizing communication hardware structure. Specifically, we use DPU as the infrastructure, leveraging the rich storage and compute resources. TianMen enables fully disaggregated storage system that bypasses the server-side CPU, and supports elastic resource pools. Experimental results show that, compared with state-of-the-art solutions: 1) Tian-Men achieves 1 RTT for GET/PUT operations and up to 6Ã— access acceleration; 2) TianMen provides CPU bypass storage network management, including 3.2Ã— speedup of metadata consistency management, per-request load balancing, and 10s microsecond-level fault recovery latency; 3) TianMen saturates the communication bandwidth when processing small payload, increasing the bandwidth utilization by 34.2%.

		<p>QLC SSDs have gained increasing popularity in cloud computing, PCs, and smartphones due to their low prices and high density, but they suffer from extremely limited endurance. Deduplication can convert redundant chunk writes into fine-grained metadata updates, thereby promising to alleviate QLC wear. Nevertheless, our observation shows that existing deduplication approaches cause even more I/Os than non-deduplication systems. We find that the amplification comes from two sources: (1) I/O amplification due to the mismatched granularity between SSD I/O size (e.g., 4--16 KiB page) and deduplication metadata I/O size, and (2) SSD garbage collection (GC) amplification due to deduplication metadata updates for eliminating redundant chunks (i.e., increment reference count). To address the above problem, this paper proposes H2C-Dedup, which employs two essential techniques. First, to address I/O amplification, cold2hot-heating technique utilizes a log-structured metadata I/O scheme, which ensures that the deduplication metadata is flushed until it is accumulated within I/O cache to match with the OS I/O granularity. Second, to address GC amplification, hot2cold-suppression technique divides metadata into hot (e.g., to store reference count) and cold (e.g., to store fingerprint) segments, delta-encoding the hot entries to ensure both hot and cold metadata will not be modified once they are durable. As a result, H2C-Dedup significantly reduces the deduplication-induced I/O and GC amplification. We implement H2C-Dedup based on F2FS. Extensive experiments on the FEMU platform using microbenchmarks and real-world traces indicate that H2C-Dedup can extend to at most 3.3Ã— and 3.4Ã— lifespan while accelerating 26% and 37% I/O performance compared to SmartDedup and HF-Dedupe.</p>

		<p>Graph processing plays a pivotal role in numerous large-scale applications, including social and transportation networks. One of the primary challenges in handling large-scale graph data is its tendency to surpass DRAM capacities. Conventional methods focus on minimizing I/O latency by decreasing disk I/O requests via predictive value calculations. However, these techniques often struggle with inefficient partitioning strategies that elevate DRAM needs, underutilized predictive calculations, and incur considerable synchronization overheads.</p> <p>In our research, we introduce and assess SmartGraph, a new graph partitioning and processing framework that is optimized for both CPU-driven systems and near-storage processing units, such as SmartSSDs.

This framework is especially advantageous in cloud environments, where scalability and efficient data management are paramount. Our experimental findings demonstrate that SmartGraph achieves an average improvement of 1.27x across four graph applications compared to the state-of-the-art framework, LUMOS, when tested on SmartSSDs using datasets like Friendster, LiveJournal, and Twitter.

		<p>Containers are widely used in multi-tenant cloud computing for their ease of deployment, minimal overhead, and fast start-up. However, the intrinsic shared kernel model of containers poses significant security threats, risking confidentiality and integrity from co-located containers or compromised OS. Researchers have proposed various methods to protect containers from untrusted OS, but few consider both the universality and efficiency. In this paper, we present ConMonitor---a lightweight and efficient container protection architecture. ConMonitor protects the security of container application data by introducing a compact virtualization software, called ConVisor, as a trusted computing base. ConVisor enforces isolation of the physical memory between containers and the kernel, and monitors the sensitive operations performed by the OS. To ensure the security of ConMonitor, we implement a Container Guardian to serve as an intermediary for the kernel, managing sensitive operations. Moreover, we also leverage the VMFUNC feature to achieve fast context switching, thereby mitigating the performance penalty associated with frequent context switching.

		<p>Real-time streaming data is generated in high volumes and consumed for statistical and analytical purposes, requiring efficient and effective management by Message Queuing Systems (MQS) that ensure high throughput and low latency. ByteDance relies extensively on MQS to handle its massive streaming data across various applications. However, existing MQS solutions often fall short of meeting ByteDance's high-volume, diverse requirements. To address these challenges, we propose ByteMQ (BMQ), a cloud-native streaming data layer designed to manage ByteDance's extensive streaming data needs efficiently in the cloud. BMQ features three key designs: 1) separation of messaging and storage, utilizing ByteDance's Federated Distributed File System (DFS) for high-performance data storage; 2) adaptive resource scheduling to balance workloads and redistribute resources across multiple availability zones; and 3) historical data restructuring to support offline applications with efficient structured data management. ByteDance has migrated 99.76% of its Kafka clusters to BMQ infrastructure, achieving about a 70% reduction in resource costs. This paper shares our journey of designing and implementing BMQ, providing insights that may benefit other organizations facing similar challenges.</p>

		<p>Meta maintains additional capacity within its infrastructure to ensure high availability for business workloads, accommodating user growth, temporal traffic variations, and unforeseen regional failures. However, this strategic choice inherently leads to underutilization of resources.

To encourage adoption, (i) our system must also support workloads with stringent availability Service Level Objectives (SLOs), and (ii) usability is important, as service owners should be able to seamlessly utilize repurposed capacity with minimal code and configuration modifications.</p> <p>To address these challenges, we first present a system that dynamically identifies idle capacity in the fleet, which can be safely repurposed. We next present a Dynamic Resource Leasing Platform that transparently leases idle capacity with SLOs, minimizing service owner involvement. We discuss our design choices and share our experience in deploying this system across Meta's infrastructure.</p> <p>This system has been in production for 3.5 years, supporting user-facing production workloads and real-time internal workloads that require capacity availability SLOs, and offline workloads.

		<p>Network functions (NFs) have become pervasive in data centers as a means to monitor and transform traffic as it flows between services. Softwarization of the network has further added to the diversity of functions that can be deployed, yet managing the performance, efficiency, tenant-customizability, and security of these functions remains a major challenge. We present Byways, an abstraction that provides facilitates to safely deploy NFs alongside end-host VMs in a multi-tenant cloud environment. Byways guarantee strict isolation between the host system, the network functions, and VM-based cloud applications, while still maintaining high performance. A Byway manages a specific set of services, and an associated NF only processes flows associated with those services, using per-byway resources (e.g., processing time). This separation of end-host traffic across Byways provides strong fault isolation - a failing NF does not impact other services. Byways augment this isolation with per-Byway access rights that restrict a NFs access (e.g., read, write, drop) to the flow, limiting the impact of a faulty NF on even its own services.</p> <p>We have implemented BywayOS, a Î¼-kernel instantiation of Byways, and evaluated its performance, efficiency, and isolation properties compared to state of the art virtual machine networking technologies. A Byway processing memcached traic through an isolated NF demonstrates throughput and latency competitive with, and often better than, Linux host performance (i.e., without a NF nor a VM), and throughput 1.25x-6.43x higher than other host NF+VM technologies, while offering stronger isolation and a trusted computing base (TCB) more than 20x smaller.</p>

		<p>As cloud-native workflow orchestration tools become increasingly important for complex data science workloads, there is a growing need for more efficient scheduling. Existing cloud schedulers rely on basic heuristics and user choice for task partitioning for parallel computing, leading to under-utilization of cluster resources and prolonged job completion times. To address this, we propose a novel workflow scheduling algorithm that leverages workflow characteristics to enhance resource utilization and reduce weighted job completion time. The algorithm combines three sub-algorithms, each reflecting a distinct aspect of the scheduling strategy: 1) Hybrid Maximum Children (MC) -Weighted Shortest Critical Path Time (WSCPT) rule alternates between two heuristics, MC and WSCPT, which prioritize jobs based on workflow structure and critical path, respectively. The choice between these heuristics is dynamically adjusted according to the cluster queue size. 2) Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA), which dynamically adjusts the number of executors assigned to each workflow, and 3) Dynamic Task Partition (DTP), which autonomously determines the task parallelism level. We tested our algorithm with extensive experiments on various workflow types using Spark-imitated simulation. Our algorithm outperformed other schedulers, including learning-based models, by reducing 21-47% of the combined performance of average job completion time and makespan for unweighted workflows and reducing at least 50% of weighted job completion time for weighted workflows.</p>

		<p>Current Serverless abstractions (e.g., FaaS) poorly support non-functional requirements (e.g., QoS and constraints), are provider-dependent, and are incompatible with other cloud abstractions (e.g., databases). As a result, application developers have to undergo numerous rounds of development and manual deployment refinements to finally achieve their desired quality and efficiency. In this paper, we present Object-as-a-Service (OaaS)---a novel serverless paradigm that borrows the object-oriented programming concepts to encapsulate business logic, data, and non-functional requirements into a single deployment package, thereby streamlining provider-agnostic cloud-native application development. We also propose a declarative interface for the non-functional requirements of applications that relieves developers from daunting refinements to meet their desired QoS and deployment constraint targets. We realized the OaaS paradigm through a platform called Oparaca and evaluated it against various real-world applications and scenarios.

		<p>Low-Earth orbit satellite networks can provide global broadband Internet access using constellations of thousands of satellites. Integrating edge computing resources in such networks can enable global low-latency access to compute services, supporting end users in rural areas, remote industrial applications, or the IoT. To achieve this, resources must be carefully allocated to various services from multiple tenants. Moreover, applications must navigate the dynamic nature of satellite networks, where orbital mechanics necessitate frequent client hand-offs. Therefore, managing applications on the low-Earth orbit edge will require the right platform abstractions.</p> <p>We introduce Komet, a serverless platform for low-Earth orbit edge computing. Komet integrates Function-as-a-Service compute with data replication, enabling on-demand elastic edge resource allocation and frequent service migration against satellite orbital trajectories to keep services deployed in the same geographic region. We implement Komet as a proof-of-concept prototype and demonstrate how its abstractions can be used to build low-Earth orbit edge applications with high availability despite constant mobility. Further, we propose simple heuristics for service migration scheduling in different application scenarios and evaluate them in simulation based on our experiment traces, showing the trade-off between selecting an optimal satellite server at every instance and minimizing service migration frequency.</p>

		<p>Acquiring data from scientific simulations for analytical purposes is inherently challenging due to the complex and irregularly shaped regions within which the data resides, particularly when using self-describing data formats. The process of region-based data distillation becomes even more arduous when employing persistent memory or parallel file systems. To tackle this challenge, we introduce RASTER (Region-Aware Self-describing daTa optimizER), a lightweight middleware designed for region-aware data preprocessing. RASTER dynamically reorganizes data into variable groups based on regional identifiers during runtime, thereby eliminating the need for sequential searches to locate the required data. We have developed a prototype of RASTER and successfully integrated it into three distinct computing environments: a single-node server equipped with IntelÂ® Optaneâ„¢ DC persistent memory, the HuaweiÂ® OceanStor cloud storage platform, and the Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer. We then conducted a thorough evaluation of the RASTER prototype on the latter two platforms using a real-world scientific application, CESM (Community Earth System Model). Our experimental results demonstrate that RASTER enhances data acquisition performance by up to 2.83Ã— and achieves a 2.36Ã— speedup over conventional netCDF and the state-of-the-art ADIOS2.

		<p>The actor model has gained increasing popularity. However, it lacks support for complex state management tasks, such as enforcing foreign key constraints and ensuring data replication consistency across actors. These are crucial properties in partitioned application designs, such as microservices. To fill this gap, we start by analyzing the key impediments in state-of-the-art actor systems. We find it difficult for developers to express complex data relationships across actors and reason about the impact of state updates on performance due to opaque state management abstractions. To solve this conundrum, we develop SmSa, a novel data management layer for actor systems, allowing developers to declare data dependencies that cut across actors, including foreign keys, data replications, and other dependencies. SmSa can transparently enforce the declared dependencies, reducing the burden on developers. Furthermore, SmSa employs novel logging and concurrency control algorithms to support transactional maintenance of data dependencies.</p> <p>We demonstrate SmSa can support core data management tasks where dependencies across components appear frequently without jeopardizing application logic expressiveness and performance. Our experiments show SmSa significantly reduces the logging overhead and leads to increased concurrency level, improving by up to 2X the performance of state-of-the-art deterministic scheduling approaches. As a result, SmSa will make it easier to design and implement highly partitioned and distributed applications.</p>

		<p>Incremental query evaluation is key to efficiently processing rapidly changing graph data. By focusing on the parts of the query results affected by updates, it avoids unnecessary computations, allowing for faster query evaluation. While this technique works well in the cases of edge insertions, its benefit quickly diminishes when the volumes of edge deletions and edge weight updates increases.</p> <p>To address the above scalability issue, this work introduces several techniques for handling large update batches that include many edge deletions and weight updates. First, for edge deletions, this work introduces a bottom-up dependency tracing method to identify the affected vertices. Unlike the existing top-down tracing, it completely avoids traversing the underlying graph, thus more scalable for large deletion batches. Second, for edge weight updates, existing graph systems treat each weight change as an edge deletion (with old weight) followed by an edge insertion (with new weight). This "two-round" method is computationally excessive. This work shows that it is, in fact, possible to handle weight updates directly. Finally, this work shows the benefits of adjusting the processing strategy according to the update volume. We integrated the above ideas into a graph system called IncBoost. Based on our evaluation, IncBoost can scale incremental query evaluation to large update batches that represent 30-60% of the graph size. By contrast, the state-of-the-art streaming graph system (RisGraph) typically fails to yield benefits when the batch size reaches 5-15% of the graph size. Regarding the absolute processing time, IncBoost consistently outperforms RisGraph with 3.1Ã— and 5.2Ã— speedups for edge deletions and weight updates on large batches, respectively.</p>

		<p>Serverless Computing has garnered significant interest for executing High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications in recent years, attracting attention for its elastic scalability, reduced entry barriers, and pay-per-use pricing model. Specifically, highly parallel HPC apps can be divided and offloaded to multiple Serverless Functions (SFs) that execute their respective tasks concurrently and, finally, their results are stored/aggregated. While state-of-the-art userside serverless frameworks have attempted to fine-tune task division amongst the SFs to optimize for performance and/or cost, they have either used static task division parameters or have only focused on minimizing the number of SFs through task packing. However, these methods treat the HPC code as a black-box and usually require significant manual intervention to find the optimal task division. Since a significant portion of the HPC applications have a loop structure, in this work, we try to answer the following two questions: (i) Can modifying the loop structure in the HPC code, originally optimized for monolithic (non-serverless) frameworks, enhance performance and reduce costs in a serverless architecture?, and (ii) Can we develop a framework that allows for an efficient transition of monolithic code to serverless, with minimum user input?</p> <p>To this end, we propose a novel framework, FAAStloop, which intelligently employs loop-based optimizations (as well as task packing) in SF containers to optimally execute HPC apps across SFs. FAAStloop chooses the relevant optimization parameters using statistical models (constructed via app profiling) that are able to predict the relevant performance/cost metrics as a function of our choice of parameters. Our extensive experimental evaluation of FAAStloop on the AWS Lambda platform reveals that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art works by up to 3.3Ã— and 2.1Ã—, in terms of end-to-end execution latency and cost, respectively.</p>

		<p>Large language models (LLMs) are ubiquitously powerful but prohibitively expensive to train, often requiring thousands of compute devices, typically GPUs. To reduce the cost of training LLMs for customers, Amazon Web Services (AWS) launched the Amazon EC2 trn1 instances, powered by AWS Trainium, an Amazon's homegrown deep learning accelerator, as an alternative to distributed LLM training. The trn1 instances provide a high-performance LLM training solution at a lower cost compared to their GPU-based counterpart, the p4d instances, which are powered by Nvidia A100 GPUs. This paper describes the design and development of the Neuron Distributed Training Library, a component of the AWS Neuron SDK, which enables distributed training of large language models on AWS Trainium. Neuron Distributed Training Library supports a variety of existing distributed training techniques with unified interfaces, and provides features to address trn1-specific challenges as well. Our evaluation shows that trn1 instances, specifically the trn1.32xlarge, achieve better or comparable performance (up to 24.6% improvement) while offering significant lower costs (up to 46.3% cost saving) in selected workloads when compared to p4d.24xlarge instances.

By leveraging insights into the statistical characteristics of gradients, we present GComp, a near-lossless gradient compression scheme designed to reduce the communication burden during data-parallel training significantly. GComp develops an optimized Huffman encoding/decoding strategy to compress gradient exponents effectively. Additionally, it introduces an innovative multi-level quantization method for mantissa, complemented by a pruning strategy that eliminates zero-valued gradients. These integrated approaches significantly reduce the volume of data for synchronization, while virtually not affecting the DNN model's training accuracy.

		<p>Storage disaggregation underlies today's cloud and is naturally complemented by pushing down some computation to storage, thus mitigating the potential network bottleneck between the storage and compute tiers. We show how ML training benefits from storage pushdowns by focusing on transfer learning (TL), the widespread technique that democratizes ML by reusing existing knowledge on related tasks. We propose HAPI, a new TL processing system centered around two complementary techniques that address challenges introduced by disaggregation. First, applications must carefully balance execution across tiers for performance. HAPI judiciously splits the TL computation during the feature extraction phase yielding pushdowns that not only improve network time but also improve total TL training time by overlapping the execution of consecutive training iterations across tiers. Second, operators want resource efficiency from the storage-side computational resources. HAPI employs storage-side batch size adaptation allowing increased storage-side pushdown concurrency without affecting training accuracy. HAPI yields up to 2.5Ã— training speed-up while choosing in 86.8% of cases the best performing split point or one that is at most 5% off from the best.</p>

		<p>The likelihood of encountering in-training failures rises substantially with larger Deep Learning (DL) training workloads, leading to lost work and resource wastage. Such failures are typically offset by checkpointing, which comes at the cost of storage and network bandwidth overhead. State-of-the-art approaches involve lossy model compression mechanisms, which induce a tradeoff between the resulting model quality and compression ratio. We make a key enabling observation that the sensitivity of model weights to compression varies during training, and different weights benefit from different quantization levels, ranging from retaining full precision to pruning. We propose (1) a non-uniform quantization scheme that leverages this variation, (2) an efficient search mechanism that dynamically finds the best quantization configurations, and (3) a quantization-aware delta compression mechanism that rearranges weights to minimize checkpoint differences and thereby improving compression.</p> <p>We instantiate these contributions in Inshrinkerator, an in-training checkpoint compression system for DL workloads. Our experiments show that Inshrinkerator consistently achieves a better tradeoff between accuracy and compression ratio compared to prior works, enabling a compression ratio up to 39x and withstanding up to 10 restores with negligible accuracy impact in fault-tolerant training.
