    title: 'Demikernel and the Future of Datacenter Operating Systems'
    abstract: 'Datacenter systems and I/O devices now run at
        single-digit microsecond latencies, requiring nanosecond-scale
        operating systems. Traditional kernel-based operating systems impose
        an unaffordable overhead, so recent kernel-bypass OSes (e.g.,
        Arrakis, Ix) and libraries (e.g., Caladan, eRPC) eliminate the OS
        kernel from the I/O datapath. However, these systems do not offer a
        general-purpose datapath OS replacement that meet the needs of
        microsecond-scale systems.  As a result, while kernel-bypass
        hardware is widely available in the datacenter, it is not widely
        used.
        
        This talk summarizes Demikernel, a flexible datapath OS and
        architecture designed for heterogenous kernel-bypass devices and
        microsecond-scale datacenter systems. Demikernel supports a variety
        of kernel-bypass hardware, including DPDK, RDMA, as well as software
        bypass solutions like io_uring. To support microsecond-scale
        operation, Demikernel includes a new nanosecond-scale TCP stack,
        written in Rust and proposes new memory management, CPU scheduling
        and network abstractions. Demikernel is currently used by Bing and
        will go into production with Azure services later this year.'

    title: 'The New Memory Wall and how it changes database system design'
    abstract: "To bridge the ever-growing memory-processor speed gap (aka the “memory wall”), computer architects introduce new levels of caching that trade capacity for speed,  and database designers develop cache-aware query processing algorithms since the late 1990s. Nowadays distributed query processing on the cloud is the norm; memory resources grow increasingly heterogeneous  and disaggregated, mitigating the benefit of cache-aware query processing techniques. Recently, in contrast with traditional CPU-centric architectures, 'memory-centric' systems that use memory pooling attract interest but also raise significant challenges as data move in unpredictable ways along a multi-dimensional memory hierarchy. Therefore, data movement emerges as a key performance bottleneck as it incurs a major cost in distributed query processing. In this talk, I will discuss the new memory wall and the challenges and opportunities it brings to database system design."

#     abstract: "The techniques and tools of distributed systems have formed the basis of the nearly two decades of phenomenal success of the cloud. But as we work to build ever-more-resilient systems, it has become clear that out our distributed computing toolkit is filled with deeply flawed tools, many of which make our task harder rather than easier. In this talk, we’ll consider the dynamic nature of distributed systems as control systems, explore the flaws in our current toolkit, and hope to find a panacea."

#     abstract: "Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for accessing parametric knowledge, but the potential of effectively tapping into the vast expanse of external or private data remains largely unexplored. This talk presents an open-source question-answering system for seamlessly integrating model parameters with knowledge from external data sources to enhance its predictive capabilities.  Our larger vision transcends question answering. We envision a personal insight assistant, adept at sifting through one's past data to offer invaluable insights to help one make informed decisions and plan with foresight."
